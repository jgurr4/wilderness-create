Things everyone should be taught before they turn 18.
NOTE: I decided to make things much more open to students to learn and self-teach about these subjects, because I grew to distrust my teachers and common philosophies so much, because many of them affected me negatively when I tried to follow their teachings or their advice without critically thinking about it. Thus the most important teacher is life and your own experiences, which means you must experiment with certain concepts to understand their truth.

 - retention scoring (give students a short term test. 1 hour to learn about several unrelated topics, then have them wait 4 hours while studying other things, then give them a quiz on those items to test their retention scores. Also try long-term test which teaches and has them pass several tests, then at the end of the year have them take those same tests again without letting them prepare except for 1 hour with no study materials to try and remember the topics.
 - basic sewing principles
 - relative measurement system
 - How to study various religions/cultures effectively without bias principles. (Basically they need to go in from the perspective of the person growing up in said religion accepting all it's foundational tenants. Not from their own current biased perspective)
 - Negotiation
 - handling conflict and arguments/fights
 - repairing relationships and forgiveness
 - communication principles (in depth focusing on who you are and who you are currently presenting yourself to the world as, consistency vs. multiple personalities)
 - preparing peoples minds for learning.
 - story-telling vs. normal teaching
 - human basic psychology principles and how it's almost never trivial or basic to understand.
 - decentralization vs centralization
 - open source vs patents and copyrights vs natural way
 - How to make money without patents and copyrights or how to make money with open source tech/inventions/knowledge
 - knot tying

 - self-taught history up to whatever depth level students feel they need for success in their respective career/goal.
 - self-taught english/reading/literature and essays/persuassive essays up to whatever level students feel they need to go to for success
 - record keeping, knowledge/truth/historical preservation techniques
 - truth vs. facts principles (truth is true no matter what the facts say, facts are capable of being manipulated and altered at many points before they reach your ears, but they can also highlight and be a true witness to the truth if they successfully reach your ears without any alteration)
 - historical art, stories, scriptures, artifacts and the truths they were made to preserve and teach us.
   - The first book ever written (the bible) what is it's significance and why is it so influential?
 - What is marriage definition and what is family definition? What consequences does it have to give it slightly different definitions? Is it purely religious, what kind of traditional ceremony is it and what was it's original purpose?
 - benefits of universal knowledge and of specific knowledge. (learning to use a specific unusual tool, vs. learning how to use a common tool that you can find everywher. (such as vim vs. intellij for computers, or learning how to use a trowel vs learning how to use a shovel)
 - law of incentives and corruption prevention
 - Government role vs. Government tyranny. (The role of government is for the common defense, it is allowed a defense budget and nothing else, it is not a charity, a church, a school, a journalistic outlet, a healthcare provider, a business, or a source of rights, it's only role is protecting our rights, and providing protection from our enemies, it should not have a monopoly on violence, punishment, judgement or currency, the moment it attempts to get involved with any of these roles is when it becomes authoritarian, and must be cut back significantly as punishment) Knowing these role restrictions and yet still coming up with a functioning useful government system is the tricky part, and that is where most of the study should be focused on for this course.
 - The role of games, sport and competition (as explained by Jordan Peterson)
 - overcoming fears/challenges and dealing with mental issues. The proper way to deal with any issues (don't accept temporary relief as much as possible, push yourself to accept as much discomfort and pain you can handle while trying to find a real cure, taking temporary relief is irresponsible, and should be a last resort in case you have tried again and again but you cannot function without and you know that you cannot endure the pain) 
    - Overcoming personal challenges and mental issues by accepting responsibilities for others voluntarily, and finding meaning in that as well as finding meaning and purpose in life in general.
 - How to handle bullies = obtaining power and learning to use that power judiciously. "A man who wields a sword and knows how to use it but keeps it sheathed is a way more useful man than one who doesn't." -Jordan Peterson.
