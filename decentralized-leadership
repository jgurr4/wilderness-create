Here is a interesting idea. Unfortunately, people are not that good at unifying over something without some form of leadership. Someone the group can look to for leading us into good habits and practices. Someone who can lead us into righteous traditions and stories and moral values who we trust enough to be persuasive without needing to work very hard to convince us. They simply must live by example and if they are successful we trust them. That is where true culture is built. Culture can never be built on the idea of pure unadulterated rationalism and logic, because people are irrational beings who make decisions and then use their intellect to rationalize their choices, not the other way around. Thus, as has always been the case, the only true way to tell who to follow is to use our discernment and follow who we perceive that is closest to the mark. Sin is missing the mark, so whoever has the least sin who also takes significant and serious actions is who we ought to follow. Here is the actual decentralized idea for leadership. I don't want people to just fork this repo and make it their own, unless they believe they have what it takes to be a leader of the people. If they do, then they should fork this repo and put their name in the fork, and we ought to see as much detail about the person as we can see. Specifically we need to know why they think their ways are better than the ways put forward by the originator or successor of these documents
