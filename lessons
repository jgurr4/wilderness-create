Lessons Learned:

#1: It's not impossible to warp pottery during the curing process. If you get the temperature too high, you can badly warp a pot. Also, it's important to be aware what you are burning on top of the pot because plastics can form a rough bubbly hard shell over the pot ruining it. So remember this, you don't have to heat it to the same temp that you would when forging metal, just having a natural campfire is enough, no need to use a bellows except to get the fire going as needed.
