Excel Sheet explanation:

It might be a good idea to have each tech in the excel sheet and each tech node represent a concept or an idea, rather than a specific form of that idea. Then I can allow infinite variations within that, and have some good variations suggested. This will greatly reduce the amount of techs we have to come up with or mention in the main branches. In the variation branches it's fine to have as many variations as we want, but for the main concept we need that to be as simple as possible.
 For example:
Basket
 variations: prawn trap basket, sieve/colander, simple basket
 definition: A basket is a container made of woven plant fibers that may or may not have space to allow stuff to fall through it
