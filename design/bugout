If I was to design a bugout bag, this is what I would bring:

- 1-2 rolls of aluminum foil: - for lining the inside of a passive solar oven
- hatchet, rake, scythe, mallet, pickaxe, and shovel heads (you can make handles anywhere)
- very compact portable ice maker - Ice can be a very wonderful material for healing strains and injuries.
- 1000 ft of paracord
- good quality backpack
- good quality portable solar panel of some kind (mostly for charging smartphone, eink device, radios, raspberry pi microcontrollers or mini pc's, or any other low power electronics)
- loudspeaker with sos capability
- eink panel with my own built in computer, which I use to store all wilderness create files for viewing on the eink screen powered by my solar panel.
- first aid materials including sunscreen, aloe vera gel, tweazers, surgical knife, surgical scissors, surgical tweazers, etc... (see emergency first aid guide)
- bug and bear spray
- seeds and herbs and ability to view medicinal and plant and animal info through wilderness create app.
- 2-4 ham radios and telegraph sounder for morse code (unless those features already exist in ham radios.
- Quality lasso for collecting animals while they are alive for farming or any other purposes.
- 1x firestarter kit such as piston, arc lighter, gas lighter, matches, etc... More permanent solution will be to make a bow drill board or a slam board out in the woods. 
- washboard, soap bar, mini brush, clothespins for washing clothes and hanging on paracord to dry
- 1x journal and 2x pencil per person
- 1x mini swamp cooler or supplies to make one (figure out how to make one out in wilderness)

clothing:
- 1x cooling rag
- 1x wide brim 360 hat (even better if it has the flap)
- sun glasses
- high quality rugged brown/grey/blue jean pants
- high quality boots or light weight sneakers
- 1x long sleeve shirt
- 4x undershirts/t-shirts
- 4x underwear
- 1x high quality thick durable pair of socks (for cold and hiking)
- 1x thin comfortable socks (for heat and hiking and working)
- 1x pair of latching sandals (for comfortable hiking when not concerened about hitting your feet with instruments or something)
- 1x thick eskimo coat
- 1x thin sweater or high quality hooded cloak (see shadiversity or lindybeige)

Self defense/hunting:
- good quality rifle and 100 rounds of ammo (This only helps temporarily, so find a long term solution later)
- arrow and spear heads or darts (I can make shaft/handles in the woods as needed)
- hooks (for fishing)

- matchete for butcher work.

wood working:
- good quality wood carving knife (for making traps)

water:

- 3x life straws
- 5x 8oz water bottles per person
- 10x water bricks (stored in my suv)
- fog net water catcher or alternative condensation tool
renewable solutions: 
 - Make water pouches from paracord and cactus or leather pouch
 - Make filter from layers of pebbles/sand/silt/charcoal dust, and sanitize through boiling
 - fog net water catcher
 - Make well
 - Find local freshwater or alternative condensation tool


food stuffs:
- my sets of camping dishes (4 of each plate-bowls, sporks, cups(with lids)
- some compact cooking pot of some kind
- 

Strategies once I've bugged out:
- Just follow wilderness create 'survival' tech tree for anything I need to make out in the wilderness.
Examples:
  - I can make a wood gasifier from clay and mud out in the woods
  - I can make glue from sap in the woods
  - I can make cement from wood ash or actual lime stone out in the woods
  - I can make a grind stone and a mortar and pestle out in the woods
  - I can make a rocket stove out in the woods
