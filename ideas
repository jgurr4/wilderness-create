Wilderness Create Ideas page:

These ideas are also tasks that people can take upon themselves to research and develop into a meaningful possible technology to add to the tech tree. 

The goal of tech trees in general, especially primitive ones, is 
1: To make sure the use of the technology serves one of the goals for independance in some way. 
2: To come up with methods to create things in the most Universally Applicable Way (UAW). 
3: To make sure that the method is as simple and straightforward and as easy as possible. Avoiding overly complicated and tricky methods wherever possible. 
4: To make sure that the method is as efficient as possible, sacrificing as little materials and energy as possible in order to complete the process effectively.

Root:
In order to understand how to master material science, you first have to understand the principle that a 'science' is not a how-to guide, but rather a specific tool, fashioned for a specific field. But you are able to come up with your own tools by your recognition of certain patterns. For instance, Geometry, is a tool we have developed and is widely used and is the best tool we have for understanding shapes in mathematics. However, if you are unlearned in geometry, and have no access to learn about this tool, you can come up with your own kind of geometry, and this can be very beneficial because you can greatly simplify the geometry concepts based on your needs/goals, and the other benefit is it helps you learn the concepts of intelligent design, and if you do decide to learn the widely used form of geometry, you can understand it better and be able to compare it's strengths and weaknesses to your own geometry. Perhaps you can make a hybrid of the two systems if they both have features you would like to keep. I use this example, because mathematics is likely the most unchanging field of study, and yet you can still develop your own form of it, there are many other fields that it would make more sense for you to study and personally develop your own variation of. But really any field of study can have inumerable variations of tools. 

#1: compressed air tanks have several flaws. one main one is that They require a high pressure tank systems to fill and contain, which is a high level technology and expensive to aquire. An alternative method can work for diving at least in shallow water 30 feet. That is the method of using a electric battery to cause electrolysis underwater, or even better a chemical reacting device that reacts something to produce the exact mixture of nitrogen and oxygen you might need for diving. Either of these methods reduces that flaw mentioned for compressed air tanks. 

#2: It's difficult for people to create glass the old fashioned way, we should still work towards doing so, and find out the most universally applicable way. But an alternative does exist, it is possible to dissolve existing soda lime glass (SiO4) using hydrafluoric acid and possibly regrow it as crystals of high purity for clear optical lenses. Or maybe a better option is to distill silicon from rice husk ash or diotamaceous earth which will produce pure silicon which also might be useful in synthesizing glass. After that it's only a matter of growing glass in the exact shape and size we need.

#3: If you require good cool air flow in your home to lower the heat constantly, it might be beneficial to create a windcatcher or a varation of one, and also to add lots of points to the edges of your home, and if you're in arid low-humidity climate to add a place for water to sit on the roof (or perhaps in an attic with air flow) in order to greatly cool the inside of the shelter. Since the water will lose the hotter molecules which float away naturally, especially in wind, and leave behind the colder water molecules, which will cool down the roof of your house, sucking away heat from inside more effectively, this combined with good insulation can help a lot. Or if you use a full on wind catcher, that can also help, but a wind catcher usually needs to be quite large and tall to be very effective, so it might be simpler just to have a place to put undrinkable water on the roof. 

#4: For food preservation, digging a hole and placing a clay lid with a bowl shape filled with water on top, will allow the food to stay much cooler because of the water wicking methods ability to cool the clay bowl and thus cool the roof of the fridge thus keeping the fridge much cooler. Also since it's in the ground, it has great insulation, and when you pick up the lid the cool air doesn't leak out nearly as much as when you open a fridge with a side door.

#5: The imperial system of measurement was never intended to be standardized. The way we know this is because it was used for many years before being standardized. It wasn't until a king decided his foot should be the standard, that we started down the path of standardization. Now this doesn't mean we shouldn't have standardized it, or that a standard system of measurement isn't needed. We do need a standard system, but we also need a relative system. Why? Because a relative system allows someone without any tools to measure things. The imperial system is actually kind of neat when you know how to use it. As long as you are using it non-commercially. It's especially useful for the wildernessCreate guide, where you might start off with nothing and have to build your own system of measurement. The metric system was clearly designed to be a standard everywhere. We don't even have a unit for micro or nano sized things, only micrometer and nanometer are used, which we are forced to borrow from the metric system. The imperial system smallest unit is a inch, which means everything smaller has to be measured in partial inches. .000001 inch for example. I actually think it is self evident that both systems are useful for different things, but the imperial system is more useful as a relative measurement system, not a standard. Metric makes far more sense as a standard. So here I will show you how to measure things relatively when you need to. (By the way it's simple to convert your relative measurements into metric system measurements in order to make it work with others measurements. Just measure your inch or your foot to find out how many centimeters they are. Without further ado here is how to use the imperial system as it was intended:

inch = Width of thumb at the base of nail. (Also used to be 1/12 of a foot, but that's not as useful for measuring as being able to hold up your thumb to something)
foot = length of your foot
yard = length of your belt or girdle
fathom = distance between tips of fingers when arms are outstretched to your sides in T-pose (sailors had to use this to measure rope a lot)
league = the distance you can walk in an hour
mile = 1000 paces
pace = distance walked for every other step in other words, 2 steps.
