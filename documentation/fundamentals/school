FUNDAMENTALS SCHOOL

Reference my recording memo. It explains the goal and how this system would work.

Description:
 - Fundamentals school is all about learning the fundamentals of human society starting with fundamental technology/human health, fundamental economics and service, then moving into fundamental relationships and meaning, and fundamental crime prevention and laws/government

 This is a decentralized organizational system, which means any community of people around the world can establish a organization based on it, this document is also a open source document, meaning anyone can edit it and make it their own and no one person or entity owns the rights to it. The original document will continue to be maintained by a single entity, but they do not own it, and as a maintainer they can involve others in the maintenance process to continually improve this document or remove any flaws in its original design. If you have any changes you wish to see in the original document, simply make the changes you wish to see and raise a pull request, and the entity who maintains it will proceed to merge your changes if it is agreeable enough.


Goals and principles behind this system:


How to organize:

How the school should be operated and what to expect from students:
 - Teachers are not babysitters, since this is a private education system, it is not tax-payer funded, so it is appropriate and constitutional to have bias and education pushing in a specific direction. However, the direction it is being pushed is not towards any politics, but rather towards fundamental human societal principles, which we is what we are biased towards learning about in this system. If there is a bias taking place that parents would rather not support, then they should not be forced to have their children go here, and can choose another school, perhaps another school using this same system but with less biased teachers/administration.
 - Students should expect to be orderly, and follow directions to a T, but while they are following directions they are given lots of freedom to experiment.
 Year 1: Students must be given the tools of learning, that being literacy, math/measurement, communication, scientific method principles and self-education/knowledge preservation, how intelligence is defined, as well as balance, (For literacy they are taught about roots/prefixes/suffixes, and also about language flow being the reason why we have many words for the same concepts. For measurement, they are taught why measurement is needed, the difference between relative (imperial system) and global standard measurements (metric system) and their uses. For math they are taught how to create math from scratch which is carried over into tech fundamentals. Communication is all about their ability to listen and respond, and also how to express their own ideas, and this involves body language and presentation of their body with clothes or style, scientific method principles just involves teaching them the way to learn what is by using scientific method, self-education involves teaching them how to learn when they are on their own, and helping them develop their own techniques that succeed, it also involves how to preserve knowledge through shared culture, rituals, stories, parables, etc..., finally balance is just introducing the concept that humans must balance their passions and traits to ensure they don't go too far and hurt themselves This concept is continued in the fundamentals of meaning.
 Year 2: If students are not yet sufficient with tools of learning, then they must take another year, otherwise they can move on to the first fundamentals subject: Fundamental technology and human health/fitness. (Here students are taught how to get by with less man-made tech, and how to create society from scratch and everything that entails like how to grow herbs for medicine, how to travel safely, how to perform first-aid, how to garden/farm or make food, how to live a healthy life, how to do proper exercise and fitness for their body, the principles of open source and decentralization etc... This will aid them in their understanding of fundamental human society, since these are the building-blocks of every society)
 Year 3: If students opt to stay learning fundamental technology, they can, otherwise they can choose to move on to the next subject, that being fundamental economics and service industry (Here they can learn exactly how to put to use everything they learned from technological standpoint and even start their very first low-level business. They will learn how to budget, investment/money tree, take calculated risks, and perform business/product evaluations, etc...)
 Year 4: Same, but now they can move onto fundamental modern society (this is where they learn things they must know for their local area, like how to do taxes, how to live as a homeless person productively and healthily, how to endure/handle prison, or how to handle police encounters, how to perform self defense or self-preservation and avoid kidnapping, or how to plan a trip out of state, how to use vim/visur, and programming dna or computers etc...)
 Year 5: Same, but now they can move onto fundamental relationships and meaning/symbology. (talks about dependance structures, fundamentals of meaning is an advanced course, it is harder to understand which is why it comes much later after scientific method, because scientific method is very simple in comparison. Meaning is rather whatever is meaningful for humans, and what tends to be the most meaningful is reached based on experience and life events and history and culture, so there is a lot more involved here, and there is in fact a correct way of thinking about what is meaningful and what is not, and we get closer to that as a culture when we learn from our past mistakes and from history. It is not very objective based, because it is almost impossible to measure, since so many factors are at play, that is why we have to rely on people to try and follow the spirit that compels them to do good, whatever that might mean for someone. This is also where religion comes into play, basically people are taught what is meaningful and they decide what is true and what isn't for their religion, and gain a testimony of those concepts, of their truth or their falseness respectively. This also involves philosophy and social studies, but social studies and philosophy tend to be woefully inadequate for determining what should be meaningful and what shouldn't be. What tends to work well, is as a society adopts a specific culture filled with meaning, it tends to have lots of truth in it, and as a society if people find wrong in it, it takes a lot more work to update it, but it is possible to update, as long as people persist in truth, thus older cultures either refine and get better, or they become worse over time, depending on the righteousness of the people. This is where cultural stories and parables filled with meaning and meant to guide individuals to good decision making are created, the archetypes are developed based on life experiences. Again these are all decentralized and no entity owns them, the bible, fairy tales, Greek and Roman and egyptian mythology are the best examples of this concept, so study those to try and understand this.
 Year 6: Same, but now they can move onto fundamental crime prevention and laws/government. (This is where students learn and develop opinions on whether corporal or capital punishment should exist, or what system of government (if any) is optimal, and how military should work, and how militias should be, and what regulations (if any) should exist, and how the government handles private property, or land management, etc...
 Year 7: Students may choose to develop any of the fundamentals they prefer, or if they feel ready, they can end schooling and pursue some adventure (perhaps a career, or volunteer or nomad or homesteading lifestyle etc... Whatever they need for their life and for their future and present family).


Here is how I define intelligence for the students:
Intelligence I think is an action, not a single metric people can pin down. Because there are many cognitive processes that we can measure and none of them on their own are responsible for what we call intelligence. We know intelligence when we see it, but describing it is always tricky because it is too broad and vague. Here is what I propose to replace that term in our daily use:

- Short term memory capacity: our ability to recall the most specific things we very recently experienced. How many moves ahead can you think in chess? How many correct steps can you remember in a rubiks cube? How many numbers of pi can you remember? Etc…
- Long term memory: our ability to recall the most specific things that we experienced more than 1 day ago. Photographic memory is not necessarily the highest capacity, because if you can only remember a few scenes in your day with perfect clarity, but forgot everything else, then you are sacrificing your capacity for many points in the day for a select few points with higher resolution. The balance is between fewer points of higher quality vs many points of lower quality. Also, remembering is often associated with the parts of our day that hold the most meaning for us.
- Performance: the speed at which our brain can absorb and process information. This is important in IQ metrics.
- Practical problem solving: the number of techniques and methods a person can use to effectively solve problems of various complexity.
- pattern recognition
- Imagination: what is within the realm of possibility for a person to imagine, how accurate are their mental models? How long can they endure imagining on a specific task to try and experiment and fail and experiment again inside their head until they solve a problem?
- Awareness: how aware is someone of their physical surroundings and also how they are being perceived by others, or aware of little details such as mispellings, crooked photos, and imperfections in a room decor or their own space. If someone solves a complex problem how many typos did they leave? Were there any words they used incorrectly? How aware are they of the physical pain in their body?
- Focus: how well and how long can someone pay attention to something? How easily distracted are they? How hard is it to draw their focus somewhere else other than what they are tasked with doing? Prayer and meditation can help here
- Deceit detection: how easy is it to fool someone? How well can they detect a trick, prank, or lie?
- Accountability, self-discipline and integrity: how well does someone hold themselves accountable for their own principles?
- Pain endurance: how much pain, fear and suffering can someone endure before they violate their own deeply held principles? Are they willing and able to voluntarily take upon themselves pain in order to uphold a righteous principle? how good are they at facing their fears? Also how much temptation can they endure? Or in other words if someone offered them relief or some reward how well do they resist it?
- Persuasion: how well can you make a case for something or how effective are you at selling something to someone else?
- Adaptability: when thrown into a completely unique and new situation, how effective are you at adapting and handling it?
- Strategy: in chess for example, how good are you at anticipating your opponents decisions and how effective are the counter measures you put in place? What is your level? And how many times have you won against similar leveled individuals? How many moves ahead can you think?
- Emotional intelligence: how good are you at having fun? Do you have enjoyable fulfilling hobbies? Can you sing, dance, play an instrument, roleplay, do a sport, perform, do comedy etc…?

Most of the mental capabilities explained above are improvable, and each one has good benefits that should not be ignored.
