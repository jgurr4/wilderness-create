COOKING FUNDAMENTALS


Explanation about what happens during cooking:
 - During the various cooking and mixing techniques, there are observable and sometimes subtle changes which occur. For example, when you churn raw milk, the physical state of the food changes to be whipped cream, keep churning and it changes state again to become butter and butter milk. But there are other changes that occur from other actions, so here are the categories I have seen so far:
    - Motion changes: stirring, churning, mixing, etc... Causing a physical state change, example churning milk to whipped cream to butter and butter milk
    - Chemical changes: Adding a ingredient which causes a reaction in the food to change it's chemical composition. For example adding rennet or distilled white vinegar to milk to curdle it and produce cheese curds and whey liquid.
    - Bacterial changes: After storing the food changes because of enzymes or bacteria inside which are either alive or dying and thus changes the resulting food. For example storing juice with yeast will produce wine (alcohol with juice), then storing that with acetate bacteria will produce vinegar.
    - Catalytic changes: A catalyst or enzymes which cause or facilitate chemical changes to a material.
    - Composition changes: Adding items that don't chemically change the product, but do combine and change the overall composition of the product. For example adding fat/oil with egg which causes emulsification so now you can mix the oil with water.
    - Separation changes: Using methods to separate a non-chemically bonded amalgam of ingredients into individual components. 3 categories for this: 
       - Heating or drying For example distilling wine to produce pure alcohol, cooking sugar to remove all the water and leave behind the less complex sucrose molecule.
       - Physical filters: cheese cloth to separate whey from cheese, using skimmer to skim cream from top of milk. 
       - Catalytic separation: adding an ingredient which either combines with or provides enough energy to a part of a solution and allows it to separate from the main solution. For example adding distilled white vinegar.
     

thicken, stabilize and emulsify various liquids:
- agar agar, comes from red seaweed and makes things stiffer than gelatin but still soft, useful for solid flavored deserts like chocolate
- gelatin comes from animal tissues. Useful for pudding and jello
- Caramel and sugar are useful for making solid candies.
- White distilled vinegar or rennet both work to curdle cassein in milk.

vegetables:
- comes from simple garden has lots of essential vitamins and nutrients to help you absorb those vitamins.
- cook in a pot of water starting with slower cooking veggies and salt
- add some vinegar if you want more bioavailability of nutrients or to speed up cooking.
- Add flavoring and nutrition with specialty veggies like tomatoes, or with mushroom tea, meat stock, bone broth for collagen, and noodles or garlic bread

Wheat and rice:
- soak overnight if you want wheat to be healthier
- grind into flour
- Add yeast to make it fluffy (bread, cakes, etc…)
- No yeast products: crackers, noodles, fry bread

Wheat rice and corn products:
- Bread: add sugar and sweet flavor like strawberry, chocolate, vanilla etc… to make into cake, pie, donuts, pastries.
- Noodles:
- Fry bread:
- Tortillas/flatbread:
- Tortilla chips:
- Fried tortillas: flour, baking powder, salt, oil and milk. Make into 8 inch round flat discs poke holes all over, then fry in oil, while frying bend it into shape when it’s halfway cooked
- Crackers:

Spices:

nuts and seeds:
 - Grow peanut plant by planting the seeds from a raw peanut shell. 130-160 days is how long it takes to grow and harvest. To make 5 jars of peanut butter you'll want to plant around 30 plants. That will get you 30-50 peanuts each which = 1/6th of a jar. 150 peanuts are needed for one 16oz jar.  
 - Peanut Butter: Make simply by roasting peanuts for 5-10 min, this allows oils to be released, then crush and blend until it turns into peanut butter. You can optionally add salt and sugar.

Tomato products:
- spaghetti sauce (cook crushed tomatoes in a pot, add water if needed to add volume, add onions, olive oil, vinegar, salt, garlic, hamburger (optional), and chopped bell peppers, any spices you want (I use basil)
- Pizza sauce
- Salsa

Dairy milk:
- Milk, yogurt, cream cheese, cream, cheese, butter, heavy cream, whipped cream, etc… all increase the creaminess of a dish including non deserts like mac and cheese, cheeseballs, cream cheese etc…
- (Butter, Butermilk, Whipped Cream): From heavy whipping cream >36-40% you can make whipped cream, or butter and buttermilk. Simply Churn the whipping cream with cold equipment until it turns into whipped cream, stop here if that is what you want. Otherwise continue and it will turn into butter once the buttermilk separates from it. Then wash the butter in ice water to remove all buttermilk. If you miss this step it will turn rancid. Now you can store the  butter for 17 years and add any seasonings you want to it. You can also use the buttermilk in salad dressings or other recipes. 
- (Mozerella cheese): only using pasturized or raw milk, not ultra-pasturized. white distilled vinegar. 20:1 milk and vinegar mixture, cook milk until it reaches 115-120 degrees farenheit, then add vinegar. Stir until you see it start to curdle, then turn off the heat allow to sit for 5 min. Next skim the cheese out of the milk and place in separate container, squeeze the whey all out of the cheese, next heat the cheese to 160 degrees farenheit. Some people cook the whey and place the cheese in there to get it up to temp, alternatively you can use the microwave or a stove. Squeeze more whey out, then place in ice cold water, continuing to squeeze the last bit of whey out. And then form it into the shape you want to leave in the ice bowl for 1-2 minutes. Take it out, pat it dry, and you can store it in the fridge.
- (Cheddar cheese):
- (Whey): Leftover whey is useful for any recipe that calls for water, since it adds a boost of nutrients, but doesn't taste much different than regular water since all the fat was taken out. 

Oils:
- preserve food, keep food from drying out, and add tasty healthy substance to foods that are lacking macronutrients
- Animal fat: rendered by heating up from animal tissue and then pouring through filter into a container, mix with beeswax to make fatwax. Add to fragrance and lye to make soap. Make lye from wood ash. Becomes solid at room temperature, perfect for applying as cosmetic products like lipstick, skin moisturizer/lip balm, and for storing food inside it, best used as frying oil
- Olive, palm, coconut oil: best for keeping things from drying out, since these don’t solidify at room temperature, that also makes them work better for recipes as ingredients better than animal fat.
- Seed or hydrogenated oils: unhealthy, only good for motors and engines and forges.

Role of:
 - salt: to bring out the flavor, increase longevity and reduce bitterness

Fundamentals of containers, cookware, utensils and dishes:
Ceramics:
 - Works as cookware for anything
 - Easily breakable if dropped
 - Can have airtight seal if the surface is perfectly smooth and you use a silicone ring on the lid, or just have plastic wrap around it.
 - Works to store any food
 - Heavy

BPA free Plastic:
 - Can disolve into the food if food is too acidic, basic or reactive
 - Lightweight
 - Durable, but still possible to break if it is dropped hard enough with enough weight inside.
 - Easy to find large containers

Stainless Steel:
 - Mediumweight
 - Most durable of all
 - Can get bad dents if you drop it too much, making it harder to seal or use as normal.
 - Easy to find large containers 
 - stovetop, oven and fridge/freezer safe
 - NOT microwave safe

Glass:
 - Heavy
 - Microwave, oven and fridge/freezer safe
 - NOT stovetop save
 - Very durable, but still possible to break if you drop hard enough
 - Has no chance to dissolve from food.
 - Harder for manufacturers to work with, so finding large containers is rare.

Wood:
 - Fridge safe
 - NOT freezer, microwave, oven or stovetop safe
 - NOT safe in humid environments

Current theory for most minimal dishes possible:
 - If you want to have the most minimal dishes possible, your best bet would be going with stackable Steel pans of various sizes with easily removable handles and air-tight capable lids (silicone stretch lids seem to work best). With these you can:
    - Cook with high heat in stovetop or oven
    - Store safely in fridge or freezer
    - cook round/square shaped breads or cakes
    - The only thing you can't do with them is cook them with microwave. 
    - Eat directly from the pots/pans, or eat using the lid as a dish, or alternatively use other dishes to eat from.
    - Being able to easily remove the handle and having optional air-tight lids for them is essential for storage
 - Pair this with ceramic or glass dishes for microwave safe cooking then eating and long-term storage. Only use plastic if you need to pack light, because it's not as resistent to heat, and not safe with all food types, only dry food, it also easily gets discolored permanently from light or food.
 - For utensils use forks, spoons, washable straws and butter/steak knife hybrids
 - For drinks use water bottles and ceramic or glass cups with detachable handles

Most versatile dishes to use for both cooking and storage, which are minimal and easy to clean:
 - One exclusive cooking and frying pan (Stainless steel 6 inches deep 12 inch Square with removable handle and a airtight lid)
 - Bowls of various sizes (small, Medium, Large)
 - Spoon and Forks and cutting butter knives
 - large plates (for keeping foods separate)
 - Large plastic cups (Like the ones in restaraunts) Or gatorade water bottles alternatively
 - Large round or square flat bottom air tight storage containers with removable compartments (simple flat pieces of plastic work for the compartments. You can store entire lunch in them, and multiple different types of foods.
 - Pitcher for pouring liquids
