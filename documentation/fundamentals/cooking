# **Cooking fundamentals**

thicken, stabilize and emulsify various liquids:

- agar agar, comes from red seaweed and makes things stiffer than gelatin but still soft, useful for solid flavored deserts like chocolate
- gelatin comes from animal tissues. Useful for pudding and jello
- Caramel and sugar are useful for making solid candies.

vegetables:

- comes from simple garden has lots of essential vitamins and nutrients to help you absorb those vitamins.
- cook in a pot of water starting with slower cooking veggies and salt
- add some vinegar if you want more bioavailability of nutrients or to speed up cooking.
- Add flavoring and nutrition with specialty veggies like tomatoes, or with mushroom tea, meat stock, bone broth for collagen, and noodles or garlic bread

Wheat and rice:

- soak overnight if you want wheat to be healthier
- grind into flour
- Add yeast to make it fluffy (bread, cakes, etc…)
- No yeast products: crackers, noodles, fry bread

Wheat rice and corn products:

- Bread: add sugar and sweet flavor like strawberry, chocolate, vanilla etc… to make into cake, pie, donuts, pastries.
- Noodles:
- Fry bread:
- Tortillas:
- Tortilla chips:
- Fried tortillas: flour, baking powder, salt, oil and milk. Make into 8 inch round flat discs poke holes all over, then fry in oil, while frying bend it into shape when it’s halfway cooked
- Crackers:

Spices:

Tomato products:

- spaghetti sauce (cook crushed tomatoes in a pot, add water if needed to add volume, add onions, olive oil, vinegar, salt, garlic, hamburger (optional), and chopped bell peppers, any spices you want (I use basil)
- Pizza sauce
- Salsa

Dairy milk:

- Milk, cream cheese, cream, cheese, butter, heavy cream, whipped cream, etc… all increase the creaminess of a dish including non deserts like mac and cheese, cheeseballs, cream cheese etc…

Oils:

- preserve food, keep food from drying out, and add tasty healthy substance to foods that are lacking macronutrients
- Animal fat: rendered by heating up from animal tissue and then pouring through filter into a container, mix with beeswax to make fatwax. Add to fragrance and lye to make soap. Make lye from wood ash. Becomes solid at room temperature, perfect for applying as cosmetic products like lipstick, skin moisturizer/lip balm, and for storing food inside it, best used as frying oil
- Olive, palm, coconut oil: best for keeping things from drying out, since these don’t solidify at room temperature, that also makes them work better for recipes as ingredients better than animal fat.
- Seed or hydrogenated oils: unhealthy, only good for motors and engines and forges.
