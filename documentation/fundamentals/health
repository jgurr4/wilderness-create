Small and Simple things: HEALTH AND FITNESS

Habits = unconsious propulsion towards some direction

Try to get a small amount of sun exposure morning, noon and before sunset. Protect your skin from it besides that

Our bodies sometimes need to breath in CO2 in order to absorb oxygen better

When food is plentiful, your nutrition should primarily come from healthy fat. Supplement that with Vegetables and protein. Carbs from fruit or grains should be considered like a occasional treat
