SYMBOLOGY FUNDAMENTALS:

Symbology allows communicating with less available space. Manufacturers often rely on symbols for their products as some regulations require them to add information explaining what process or material a product was made from. For example BPA plastic has the symbol of a triangle made of arrows with a number in the middle designating what ___ it used. These are important in plastics since some plastics are safe to use for food storage, microwave, or freezing, and others are not.

It is important for people to be able to have a online dictionary of symbols so they can easily lookup one that they fail to recognize, this is even more important than a dictionary for words, because at least with words there is context surrounding them to help you guess what they mean, but symbols are almost always without any useful context.
