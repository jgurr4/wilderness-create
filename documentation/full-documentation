[[placeholder: put the explanation of unified-nature-theory here from my phone notes]]

==================================================
Explanation of how things work based on everything I've learned so far:
It seems as though this world is filled with repeating patterns. The patterns that allow us to survive as a species are those relating to fulfilling our basic necessities. Technology, food, water, shelter and comfort. Some example patterns are: invisible microoranisms that provide us the most universal and accessible materials to meet our temporal needs. Another is common materials that are also universal and provide us with the tools we need. Finally there is the ecosystem itself which is capable of taking dead or dying life matter and turning it into new life or maintenance materials for existing life. By far the most impactful patterns are those that when you learn them make you question things like "Why doesn't modern school teach us this, when it is so practical and universal, whether poor or rich?" or "Can such a usefully ordered and well designed thing exist on accident without the influence of a higher being? If so, that is more than incredible" It is almost as though this world was designed for us to be able to progress quickly without much effort on our part aside from simple experimentation.
Here are some examples:
 - Wild Yeast microorganisms exist everywhere in the air, they give us bread and wine/alcohol
 - Wild Acetic microorganisms also exist in the air, they give us vinegar
 - Wood exists everywhere, when burned in various ways it produces charcoal and wood ash.
 - Charcoal burns hotter than wood, and especially based on the more oxygen you give, and it makes a perfect fuel for many things including metal forges or foundries.
 - Wood ash provides lye when you soak and strain it, which can be turned into soap, or used to decompose living flesh as it is a powerful base.
 - The remaining wood ash can be used to make wood ash pots or cement
 - wood ash also works as a glaze for pottery.
And so on:
Inspired by these many useful truths, I want to also discover universal methods for determining the properties of an unkown plant such as edibility, toxicity, health benefits, health concerns, medicinal uses, etc... I also would like to discover universal methods for determining the way in which you must propogate and harvest a unknown plant, and also the ideal conditions for its growth, i.e. what climate and season it prefers.
I would like to discover universal patterns in chemistry, at least the most common types of chemistry we witness every day. As well as the universal patterns of microorganisms.
Also math, fitness, measurement, budgeting, cooking etc...
But before I go too deep into those topics I mainly wish to develop the wildernessCreate tech guide. So people can immediately go out into the woods, and follow these techniques and advance, not just to the bronze age, not just to iron age, but all the way past the modern age! I believe it can be done, because it has been done before. Our society made the advances it did because of righteous people being allowed to pursue truth. 

==================================================
Most noteworthy things I've learned: All these things do not contain stuff that already requires significant advancement such as 'steam engine' or 'black ink' even if some of these are components for those techs. Also keep in mind I don't mention all the possibilities here, just the ones I know about and the most important for wildernessCreate. There are many more possible things you can do with any of these materials/techs. For full descriptions of each of these steps follow the survival guide.
RULES: 1: Always provide the node possibilities immediately after they are mentioned by another node. Unless it requires something else, in which case make the node for that other thing first, then do this node.
wood - burned with oxygen produces -> charcoal
     - burned without oxygen produces -> wood ash
mud clay - main ingredient for -> kiln, forge, furnace, adobe(mud) brick, refined clay
charcoal - fuel for -> kiln, forge
	 - Material use for -> water filter
wood ash - Rinse and strain produces -> lye
	 - main ingredient for -> cement, wood ash pot 
	 - mixed with clay and water -> wood ash glaze
	 - used for -> cleaning without soap technique
adobe(mud) brick - main component of -> adobe brick hut
adobe brick hut - used for -> shelter, workshop, bigger kilns/furnaces/forges
refined clay - main ingredient for -> pottery
kiln - used for -> curing pottery
forge - used for -> smelting/forging/melting metal
water filter - produces -> filtered water
lye - main ingredient for -> soap
cement - main ingredient for -> grinding wheel
wood ash pot - alternative to -> clay pot
glaze - applied during curing process -> glazed pottery
cured pottery - used for -> plant pot, ouya , evap cooled root cellar, cooling roof tiles
ouya - used for -> evaporative cooling drinking bottle, or passive irrigation
glazed pottery - used for -> food/drink container, cooking pot, insulative roof tiles
sweet fruit - Juicing produces -> sweet fruit juice
sweet fruit juice - left outside -> wine
wine - distilled -> alcohol
     - left outside -> vinegar
vinegar - cooked with vegetables -> speeds up softening process and makes more bioavailable for some foods like corn, potatoes, carrots, onions, etc... 
        - cooked with meat -> adds flavor
	- covering food in container -> preserves food
alcohol - used for -> disinfectant
