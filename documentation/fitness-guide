Fundamental principles:

#1: Understand that our lungs, tendons, muscles, bones, fat, heart/arteries, skin, mind and joints all can be strengthened through training, and there are exercises that focus on some and ignore others. So ensure you do exercises that focus on all of these. These are the 5 foundational aspects of human strength. Cardiovascular, skeletal, joint, tendon, and muscle. Here are the ways to train each category:

fat: Cold training is the ability to adapt our body to be more resiliant to cold, also to train the mind not to fear the cold, because there is a limit to how shocking it gets to our senses. To train cold is a dual benefit, it helps reduce inflamation in tendons and joints after serious workouts, and it also helps develop your resistance to cold and develop more 'brown fat' over time which can be beneficial as it burns energy directly to keep you warm without requiring movement. Eskimos and people who constantly live in colder climates tend to have higher amounts of brown fat. There is also the ability to add fat stores to the body without letting it seriously affect your athleticism like the sumo wrestlers do, but I have yet to discover the usefulness of this or if it has any practical benefits.

lungs: To train lungs is natural for some endurance exercises or ballistic movements, but to focus training on lungs you can do breathing exercises, and also try inhale/exhale exercises with resistance. Like blowing up a balloon, or trying to breath through a skinny straw.
For lung training, you can do resistance with a balloon, or breathing through a straw, or do high altitude training, both work different things for the lungs. Or you can simply focus on performing specific breathing exercises like wimm hoff breathing technique, or a tai chi breathing technique or other various breath holds.

Tendons: To train tendons, simply bend a joint until the muscle you want to train is in a stretched position, then add a little bit of resistance to that stretched position. Or even more effective, go into the stretched position same as before, and wrap a tightened rope around to prevent you from moving out of that position, then try to push against the rope while in that stretched position.

Muscles: To train muscles most effectively you would want to train them in comfortable range of motion and comfortable weight until you can effectively reach high ranch of motion and high weights.

cardiovascular: To train the heart for cardio, simply do daily exercises, but especially try doing a series of movements without stopping, and focusing on breathing the entire time. 1 hour is a good longevity for movements. Full body movements are best. Jacobs ladder is one of the best type of movements since it involves full body, not just legs. There is a real life strategy for strengthening and toughening areas by purposely hitting them in a controlled and careful manner to cause bruises at first, and then over time that area becomes more resilant to blows. See the Shiaolin monks for example, They will practice hitting a sack of rice with blade hands, and also hitting each others forearms together in order to toughen these areas. The first week or so it causes bruises, but after that the area does adapt and become tougher, I am unsure of what is actually going on here, but most likely it is actually strengthening the capilaries near the skin, or simply cushioning them with more tougher fat/muscle/skin tissue, or both. Either way it seems this 'toughening' process is actually quite evident, as many men have obtained tougher bodies during training, to be able to accept blows to the face or body without it causing as much damage. It might seem counter productive to damage our tissue to make it stronger, but that is actually what is happening for our muscles when we develop micro-tears in the hopes that it will heal with stronger and larger muscle tissue, so while it may not be the case for all aspects of our body, it is possible this works just as well for our capilaries/fat/skin as it does for muscle tissue. Though you must pay careful attention to what is happening to your body when you undertake such stressful training, because it can backfire easily.

Bones: Weight training is most effective for bone strength. high weight, low reps.

Joints: To train joints, mostly it is about giving your joints a break, not really about training them, but you can think of it as training if you want. Basically the way to train joints is to perform tai chi movements with a focus on tendons. You are not trying to work tendons to get them way stronger, you are simply trying to stabilize them and relieve pain points in your joints and tendons. This works your heart as well if you do it for 1 hour straight.

Skin: To train skin, is more about training it's strength and elasticity, but also if you develop callouses, that can be very useful as well. I am not aware of a good program meant specifically for skin yet.

Here is all the workout equipment you'll need to perform any of these types of training:
rope
sand bags and handles
strong metal bar able to handle lots of weight
Platforms or bench or changes in elevation
squat bar rack (optional)
vest/body suit compatible with sand bags (optional)


Every day you should decide what you are training. Bones, tendons, muscles, heart or joints. It is probably important to train several things per day. So one day could be tendons and muscles, the next could be muscles and heart, the next could be joints and lungs etc... In fact I think rest days would be the days where you focus on joints and lungs. So tai chi and breathing day.

Here is what training could look like for tendons:
 - Bicep pushups
 - rope resistor movements of all types
 - sled pulls using the sand bags
 - lunges
 - knees over toes or deep squats
 - ballistic hops or movements

Here is what training could look like for muscles:
 - tricep curl
 - bench press
 - squat
 - bicep curl
 - hamstring curl
 - pullups
 - wrist curls/rotations

Here is what training could look like for heart:
 - Jacobs ladder
 - bodyweight exercises
 - running/hiking/jogging/biking/swimming
 - sprinting
 - If have a vest/body suit, then sand bag weighted training is an option here

Here is what training could look like for bones:
 - High weight squat/deadlift/bench press/

Here is what training could look like for joints:
 - Tai Chi  (tai chi actually trains tendons, heart, joints and even muscles at the same time, but it's primary usefulness is to give our joints a break and aid digestion/breathing)
 - back or hip stretches/exercises
 - tendonitis relaxation/relief techniques

Here is what training could look like for lungs:
 - wim hoff breathing technique
 - tai chi breathing technique
 - inhale/exhale resistance
 - deep breath hold
 - no breath hold

NOTE that all the above examples train multiple things at once, but they are listed under specific things so that you can know what the most effective examples are for training for a specific purpose. All these things do overlap a little.

#2: Understand that if your belly is full all the blood in your body will work in the digestion system and not be fully available for working out. So only workout at least 1 hour after eating.

#3: Understand that when performing a movement that has too great resistance for your muscles, your tendons will be relied upon, and if the tendons are not strong enough, the bones and joints will be relied upon, and if those are not strong enough, then they will be damaged. For example trying to force your way to chew through a material that is too tough for your muscles and tendons in the jaw to handle, could end up injuring your jaw or if you have strong jaw strength but weak teeth, then you could break a tooth. This is one reason you should not ignore any of these, but especially learn how to train them each, as shown above. For example, tendons in the jaw can be exercised for this movement, by simply having something that makes your jaw have to open as wide as possible, and then try to push as hard as feels comfortable to chew through the object with your teeth, and hold that for 6 seconds. Having strong tendons is one of the secrets to true strength, since again the muscles will often run into things too difficult to push through, at which point the tendons have to be relied upon to generate the additional force required to push through.
