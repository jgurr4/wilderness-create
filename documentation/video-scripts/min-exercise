Minimal Exercise system:

This exercise system is based on the ../fitness-guide

Basically we are focusing on different components of our bodies at different days. Below is a example of a weekly routine.

---Weekly routine---
Monday: cardio and joint
Tuesday: tendon and cold (maybe also bone)
Wednesday: tai chi and breath/lung
Thursday: Skill
Friday: muscle and bone

Each workout should take 1 full hour. If you finish the main workout before the hour is up you should always use the remaining time to do tendon/back stretches or tai chi based on what you feel is needed most for your body, pay attention to what you feel in your body, what is in pain or stiff or weak.

see ../fitness-guide for what exercises are good examples for each category of training.

For Thursday skill training, that means do any physical skill you wish to develop, it could be flips, handstanc, high jump, long jump, parkour, gymnastics, sports, kickboxing, archery, horseback riding, cliff diving, facing various fears, etc...

I found some of the best exercises possible for my system. Here are a few of them:

For tight hamstrings:
 - sit on ground and place a weight or immovable object between legs as far forward as you can reach. Reach for it and try to pick it up. Think about letting your stretched hamstrings attempt to be what takes the force.

For tight quads and front knee:
 - Place foot behind body on a loop or ledge that holds the knee in a fully bent position which means the quad should be in a fully stretched position, then try to resist against it using the quad muscle that is fully stretched.

Good tendons exercises:

 I have finally realized how to explain what we need for a fitness program in the world for every human being. No exercise routine is ever going to be beneficial long term without this. Meaning if you do other routines that are not addressing your main physical issues, then you will only see those physical problems persist, and probably get exacerbated by your routines. There is one single routine that is good for you to do every day. And the only way you can understand what that routine is, is to do 2 things, 1: understand what are your main problems, and 2 experiment with movements until you find the ones that work, in some cases you may need to try experimenting with thousands of different exercises recommended by physical therapists, before you find the right combinations for your needs. And surprisingly, or perhaps unsurprisingly, you'll sometimes find key movements or patterns not taught by any therapists, from a random person posting on the internet who happens to have the same symptoms as you. I'll use myself as an example here. So I went to physical therapy for years, and I went to many doctors to try and find out what was going wrong, for a while diagnosis was almost always incorrect, then after we narrowed down the problems I have, we spent many years attempting to address those problems. Exercise after exercise of all types of movements and stretches we sent to me, yet none of them worked. Some would feel good temporarily, but the effects would wear off, so repeating the movement wouldn't work long term. I gave up a few times, until my back pain would get so bad again that I literally couldn't work anymore. So I would keep coming back to solve this issue. I started developing a repoitoire of exercises and stretches that seemed to do some good, even though they didn't completely fix my problem, I would feel much worse going anywhere or doing anything without first doing this routine every day. So this became my primary routine, it wasn't perfect, but it helped me at least be functional again. Eventually I actually did find ways to perfect the routine even more every day. Now I can actually do other things like sports, and weight training and even rock climbing just like I used to, because this primary routine lets me reverse some of my physical problems that I have through lifestyle, genetics and past injuries. In other words, this is a daily required routine, in order for me to be functional, all other routines are secondary and I can actually do without them completely. So here are the steps for anyone who wants to develop a primary routine for their body.

1 understand what your main problems are.
 - These are caused by 3 things, your lifestyle, your genetics, and your past injuries. For example, for me, my lifestyle revolves around sitting in a computer desk for 12-16 hours per day, every day. I have to just spend 30 min of maintenance on my body per day in order to reverse the long-term effects my lifestyle has on my body. So in particular I have to train my hips, legs, my shoulders, arms and my spine in particular ways so as to reverse the tightness of the muscles and tendonitis that is caused from sitting so long. As far as genetics goes, I am predisposed to foot pain, and back pain, and overall joint pain. So I kind of have to deal with these things otherwise they will get worse. Finally as far as injuries goes, I have made the mistake of forcing myself to train physically for many years without a primary routine that reverses my problems caused by my lifestyle and this I believe is one main cause of my serious chronic conditions now which have caused all my joints to be in pain, and my spine to go out at least 1-2 times per month, and for me to have to lay down very often when the pain from sitting gets too high. So once you understand what your main issues are, it is then possible to try and target each issue one at a time and figure out good exercises that seem to provide reliefe. Particularly for lifestyle pains, the best thing I have found is finding things that train and strengthen/stretch your tendons that are nearest to the joint or muscles that are in pain.
2 experiment with movements until you find the ones that work
 - So like I mentioned before, spend lots of time experimenting with various physical therapists advice, and try also unconventional ideas shown online from people who have to deal with this issue just like you. Don't take advice very often from people who say something helps, but they themselves never had the problem, so they are not as reliable. But if you find someone online who says they had back pain, and found some exercises that actually helped them fix it, then that is more reliable in my experience. Sure people could be lying, but assuming everyone you watch is trustworthy, then the person who has had the problem and wants to show you exercises they used to solve it, is more reliable than someone who heard about or did studies on particular issues and think they have the solution for you, even though they may be overgeneralizing symptoms and causes which is what tends to be what causes their advice to only work for some people. It's not bad to try their ideas out, but overtime I realized more and more that when I followed these routines rather than the former, the former tended to be more beneficial and relate directly to my issue.

Exercise Journal: 
 - Every individual should use a exercise journal and do their exercises for 1 hour every day plus 10 min afterwards to write their experiences in a journal. This will lead to revelation if they seek truth

Day 1 Dec 28 2022: I learned that going to the rec center and doing max weight, max endurance and max tendon training is not enough for fixing injuries. It is good for you, but it cannot tackle your weaknesses effectively, because these things are most often targeting compound movements/muscles and rarely focus on a problem zone like physical therapy does.
 I need to do my physical therapy daily before doing my max cardio/endurance/weight/tendon/lung training. Those are all secondary. Although arguably cardio is probably the second most important one to do, so if you can do cardio at least 1-3 times per week in a comfortable manner that doesn't aggravate your injuries that is good.
 Anyway, here is my experience today: 
   - I tried doing tai chi, it was good, and helped work my shoulder/elbow/spine/leg tendons in ways I had never thought of before. Nevertheless I didn't enjoy having my fingers outstretched the whole time. After the tai chi exercise I was still in need of something else, it didn't completely fix my problem with my spine and tight low back, though it did give me a couple of good ideas. Here are some movements I really liked from tai chi:
   - arms reach straight forward as far as possible to bend toward ground and place hands on ground to stretch spine tendons
   - Variation of above but with straight back.
   - hand behind spine other hand raises up, and stretch in various ways.
   - (Rewatch video for more ideas to add here)
   One way I could improve my tai chi is to do some of the movements way slower and longer than they did, to work my tendons and stretch them even more. I also want to combine this as like a warmup routine to do right before I do some of my tendon stretches.
   - For tendon stretches I really enjoy strap around my head while bent down resistance with my 50 lb sand bag. 
   - I also want to try standing on a platform with strap around my hand/wrist and bending down as far as possible with resistance.
   - I enjoyed doing a laying on my back with a strap around my thigh and pulling against the 50lb sand bag. Pulling it towards my chest.
   - Standing on a 50lb sand bag I used it as a platform do perform jefferson curls with my 10lb sand bag. It worked really well at working my upper thoracic spine.
   - It is also possible to do a similar spine stretch by placing one hand on head and using it as to resist against after you are bent over in a fully stretched position for the muscles in the spine.

IDEA: What if you had a pulley that was attached to rails so it can be adjusted like many exercise machines have. This way you can adjust the angle, and make the strap something that can be wrapped around any part of the body, and attached to the pulley would be another pulley that is on the roof, which is attached to the weighted sand bag, so that the sand bag can be pulled against. And the goal is to pull the sand bag manually, but then when you need to stretch something, get into that stretched position with the weight, and then resist it. I'll see if I can test this or come up with a simpler idea.

Day 2 Dec 29 2022: In the morning I immediately performed manual labor by cleaning and selling some things that were cluttering my home. But doing so made me neglect my daily exercise in the morning. I will try to start doing exercise every morning before I do anything else, because my low back and heart always feels worse if I don't. And I end up taking more breaks from work than I want. For exercise in the afternoon this is what I did:
 - forward bear crawls 5/10 for low spine relief
 - backward crab crawls with knees over toes. 5/10 for low spine relief
I also tried the Tai Chi video again and actually it felt pretty good for my spine, even though there were parts where it was pretty tough on my spine. Here are some of the movements I liked and would like to pursue perfecting them with resistance or form adjustments or timing.
 - Lunge to one side and reach arms out in warrior pose and make fists with both hands, then move forward arm toward its shoulder as far as it can reach basically your trunk should turn here.
 - Place one hand on base of head/neck, and one arm behind back, bend forward opposite elbow to opposite foot. 
   - Same position, only now try standing straight and turn elbow towards opposite shoulder to twist trunk and spine as far as you can comfortably.
 - Tiger claw reach forward as far as you can to work spine tendons.
 - Arms out at sides bent 90 degree elbows and palms face up to stretch upper thoracic spine.

Day 3 Dec 30 2022: I was supposed to go early to exercise at the rec center, but then I realized the rock wall doesn't open until 10:30. So instead of going to rec center, I did realize that if I am uncomfortable or not feeling like going much, I still have to go, because doing so makes it easier to go in the future, and I'll learn to minimize energy cost while going. So anyways this is what I did instead:
 - Pushup position on sand bag try to hop legs forward and back and then try turning legs toward one side, and then other side. Repeatedly.

Day 4 Dec 31 2022: I went to the rec center today despite having a injured back and not feeling much like going. The purpose of me going was for ensuring I stay in the habit of going, so that when my body does feel like going it will get the most benefit, and even if it doesn't feel like going, even if it is slightly detrimental to my body, I will go and just be more careful while there, so that I don't injure myself, and so I keep my body in this habit. I will say that my back felt worse during and after going, but my back is feeling much better after I rested a bit. So perhaps even though it hurt more in the short term, my body was able to heal better after being active and getting some rest.
 - I learned something interesting at the rec center. They have a steel cage made for various stretches. At first I thought this is exactly what I was looking for in a stretching implement. However, I realized after attempting stretches on it for about 20 minutes, that none of them were satisfying my need to strengthen tendons. Some tendons it might, but most it was not working, especially the spine tendons. That was when I realized the important difference between this system and systems I think work is the ability to attach anchors to any limb and part of the body. Because this relied on the fact that your feet and hands were the only anchors. Nothing else was an anchor. Whereas we need our neck and head, and shoulders, and wrists, and thighs and calves and ankles and hips and torso to be anchor points. So without anchor points performing tendon exercises is much more difficult.
 - Created a head harness with velcro straps, in order to see about creating some healthy tendon stretches. I haven't been able to use it yet, but I am excited to try
 - I focused on making progress with rotational spine tendon exercises today. So I managed to do one that seemed to have promise, though it is not perfect. Basically you take a rope Attached to a wall anchor, then wrap the rope around your shoulder, and face the opposite direction with your feet/legs/hips and step forward and allow the rope to pull your arm in front and around your body, that is the stretched rotational position. Next just try to use your rotational muscles to try to return to the non-stretched position. I learned that I need some kind of cushion for the rope. I'll try to devise one that can be removed and added at any point as needed.

Day 5 Jan 1 2023:  What I did today was pretty good. I decided to try hip movements again, and I realized they work the tendons in the leg pretty well, so I decided to also try shoulder movements, by lying on my back and raising my hands above my head and doing various arm circles or straight arm lifts, and it had a similar benefit as the hip exercises did. So that was good for me. In this way, perhaps I don't need to add more resistance to get tendon training, perhaps for tendon stretching, although perhaps this does that too the longer I do them. Because the more reps you do, the more tired your muscle gets, and the more your tendons have to become active to compensate.
 - Hip movements (lie on one side and do leg raises, kicks, circles, and bicycles)
 - Shoulder movements (lie on back and do arm raises, extensions, circles, and bicycles) 
    - Next time also try lying on side and doing different shoulder movements.
 - I also did back movements by laying the front of my hips on a soft cusion on the arm of my couch, and with arm assistance I managed to bend forward and do straight lifts, followed by forward circles.

Day 8 Jan 5 2023: Today I discovered that there are more ways to rest than sleep. You can rest your back, your knees, your guts even, your heart etc... We should be doing various forms of rest every day, and we only should be needing around 3-4 hours of deep sleep because then our body repairs itself, and our mind can also be reinvigorated. Learning how to rest in other ways is vitally important, and I think it requires various positions, you have to be able to sit and stand and crouch and lay in various positions which emphasize rest for various purposes. Most importantly, if you're trying to watch a show, that is not good rest. Best rest can be while listening to something, or by recording your audible thoughts.
 - Today I hooked up a light weight to my pulley, and because the pulley is not designed for weight training, even the small weight was basically doubled in strength requirement. So I was able to do some good tendon exercises in the arms, particularly in my shoulders and forearms and wrists and fingers. I simply used a bar (stick) and tried wrist curls. I also tried pull-downs with wrists in stretched position basically the entire time until the end when the momentum raised the weight a bit. Forward wrist curls and behind back wrist  curls worked great. I also tried arm curls with arms behind back which stretched the front of my chest and shoulders a lot. This was definitely a good tendon based routine.
 - I also tried hooking ankle strap to it, and did leg stretches, particularly the hamstring stretches. If I make another pulley, it can be attached to do vertical movements and that should expand my possibilities. After that, it might be good to attach a pulley to the ground as well. So I can do some exercises with the anchor directly below me.
