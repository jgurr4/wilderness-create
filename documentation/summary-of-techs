SUMMARIZATION OF TECHS AND HOW THEY ARE OBTAINED:

Most noteworthy things I've learned: All these things do not contain stuff that already requires significant advancement such as 'steam engine' or 'black ink' even if some of these are components for those techs. Also keep in mind I don't mention all the possibilities here, just the ones I know about and the most important for wildernessCreate. There are many more possible things you can do with any of these materials/techs. For full descriptions of each of these steps follow the survival guide.
RULES: 1: Always provide the node possibilities immediately after they are mentioned by another node. Unless it requires something else, in which case make the node for that other thing first, then do this node.

==================================================
Explanation of all the processes:
sintering of clay
sintering of metal:
 - use a clay mold to hold pieces of metal together while heating it as hot as possible.
Making coke:
 - You can indirectly make coke by keeping coal/charcoal near the edge of your forge. It's not as dense as the industrial stuff, because it expands more. But I think it should get just as hot. So this is the most simple way to do it. Otherwise if you need it in bulk just pyrolyze charcoal in a oxygen free environment again.
 - You can make bulk amounts of coke by placing charcoal inside a thin clay container with a loose lid, and surrounding it in a fireplace, it will release tar at 1000 deg f. Usually takes 1.5 hours to completely release, you'll be able to tell by checking to see if any more smoke is coming from the charcoal inside the container. Coke burns hotter because the tar and other impurities are burned out of it, These impurities get in the way of the airflow and the combustion process for charcoal.
Smelting/melting metal:
 - The best way to melt metal is to either melt it inside a thin walled clay pot, or to have the flames hitting the metal directly by using a draft furnace, while the metal sits on top of a or drain which has a mold underneath to catch the metal and allow it to form the rough shape you want. Then use blacksmithing techniques from there to further shape/grind/sharpen/harden it.
Foraging technique:
 - The best way to forage if looking for exotic things is to travel as much distance in the shortest amount of time by hiking or marathon running in the wilderness. Make sure you keep a keen eye out for certain things, it also helps if you know or heard of people spotting certain materials in the area you're heading. For example you might come across obsidian while hiking a trail. Just be careful of snakes, scorpions, mountain lions, bears, and other dangerous wildlife that might end your trip quickly.
Making adobe/mud/clay walls:
 - If using mud/adobe, you should mix with straw or dung and form into bricks. If using clay, simply form into bricks. then stack the bricks on top of each other with mortar. The mortar can be the same material the bricks are made from.
Making slaked lime - Easiest to use a mortar and pestle with small amount of water, just crush the shells into the water.
