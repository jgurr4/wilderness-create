SUMMARIZATION OF TECHS AND HOW THEY ARE OBTAINED:

Most noteworthy things I've learned: All these things do not contain stuff that already requires significant advancement such as 'steam engine' or 'black ink' even if some of these are components for those techs. Also keep in mind I don't mention all the possibilities here, just the ones I know about and the most important for wildernessCreate. There are many more possible things you can do with any of these materials/techs. For full descriptions of each of these steps follow the survival guide.
RULES: 1: Always provide the node possibilities immediately after they are mentioned by another node. Unless it requires something else, in which case make the node for that other thing first, then do this node.

land - foraging -> hard rocks, fruit, mushrooms, seeds, animals, wood/bark/sticks, plant cordage, kindling, clay soil, beehive
mushroom - used for -> decomposing cellulous to provide food for plants/animals/people
wood - burned with oxygen produces -> charcoal
     - burned without oxygen produces -> wood ash
clay soil - main ingredient for -> kiln, forge, furnace, adobe(mud) brick, refined clay
charcoal - fuel for -> kiln, forge
	 - Material use for -> water filter
wood ash - Rinse and strain produces -> lye
	 - main ingredient for -> cement, wood ash pot 
	 - mixed with clay and water -> wood ash glaze
	 - used for -> cleaning without soap technique
adobe(mud) brick - main component of -> adobe brick hut
adobe brick hut - used for -> shelter, workshop, bigger kilns/furnaces/forges
refined clay - combine with grog and water -> moldable clay
moldable clay - coil process -> round or flat bottom pots/cups/bowls/containers
	      - left to dry slowly -> greenware
kiln - used with greenware pottery -> terracotta
     - used with terracotta and glaze -> glazed pottery
forge - used for -> smelting/forging/melting metal
water filter - produces -> filtered water
lye - main ingredient for -> soap
cement - main ingredient for -> grinding wheel
wood ash pot - alternative to -> clay pot
glaze - applied during curing process -> glazed pottery
terracotta - used for -> plant pot, ouya , evap cooled root cellar, cooling roof tiles, puki, flat slab or cylinder
puki - used for -> base for more easily making round bottom pots/bowls/cups on turntable surface that also releases the work easily
flat cylinder - used for -> pottery making on flat and turntable surface.
flat slab - used for -> food preparation or earthenware work
ouya - used for -> evaporative cooling drinking bottle, or passive irrigation
glazed pottery - used for -> food/drink container, cooking pot, insulative roof tiles
sweet fruit - Juicing produces -> sweet fruit juice
sweet fruit juice - left outside -> wine
wine - distilled -> alcohol
     - left outside -> vinegar
vinegar - cooked with vegetables -> speeds up softening process and makes more bioavailable for some foods like corn, potatoes, carrots, onions, etc... 
        - cooked with meat -> adds flavor
	- covering food in container -> preserves food
alcohol - used for -> disinfectant
animal - hunt and kill -> animal fat, bone, leather, feather, claw, antler/horn and more...
hard rocks - pecking/knapping process -> stone hammer/axe/adze head, chisel, sharp rocks
sharp rocks - pecking/knapping process -> stone drill/arrow head, stone cutter
stone axe - chopping thin branches/trees and shaping wood -> branch mallet, lengths of wood 1-6 in. diameter
stone drill/arrowhead - drill hole in wood/bark -> firestarter base, 
		      - unlocks -> wood pulley, clay sifter, arrow
firestarter base - unlocks -> fire
1-6 in. wood - digging stick making process -> digging stick
branch mallet - hit blunt end of chisel -> make holes in wood
stone chisel - chisel hole with branch mallet -> wooden handle, yoke
stone cutter - making grooves in wood, cutting/chopping plants -> plant strings/vines
plant strings/vines - twist in both hands process -> plant cordage
		    - unlocks -> measuring string
plant cordage - combined with handle and hammer/axe/adze head -> axe, hammer, adze
	      - woven -> basket
	      - knot tying -> nets, ladders
basket - used for -> sifting, carrying non-fluid things, trapping
trapping - in water -> crawdads
antler - tied to handle -> antler pickaxe
antler pickaxe - used for -> digging through stone
animal fat - boiled and strained -> rendered fat
rendered fat - used for -> dipping cloth in it to wrap around wounds to seal/protect from bacteria after already washing with water, and disenfecting with alcohol/wine.
beehive - use smoke to confuse bees -> honey, honeycomb beeswax
beeswax - combined with rendered fat -> fatwax
fatwax - used for -> rub on wood/iron to preserve it
wood pulley - unlocks -> pulley based machines
ironsand/sand sifter - water sifting process -> ironsand, sand === explanation: a concave slab of terracotta that has grooves in it which when combined with running water and soil at an angle traps ironsand or sand itself if at a lighter angle.
ironsand - smelting process -> iron prills
iron prills - sintering process -> iron arrow/spear/axe/adze/pickaxe/hammer/drill/scythe head or cutting blade/saw
iron pickaxe - unlocks -> more efficient and durable mining through solid stone
peg gear - 
capstan - 
yoke - used for -> carrying pots/buckets/baskets of stuff with much less effort
measuring string - unlocks -> relative measurement system (imperial)
relative measurement system - used for -> more accurate recording of lengths for use in calculations of dimensions for things you make.
