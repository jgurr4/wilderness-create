herbs
 - herbs are among the most medically important plants to grow. They are a suitable and in some cases safer with less side effects method of curing physical and mental ailments than drugs from a pharmacy.

cooking
 - cooking from scratch requires some amount of foraging or gardening skills. The incredible nature of food is evident in the reality that almost all our foods rely on certain elements in nature that provide for us. Such as yeast and acetates which floats in the air, animals which are normally a conversion of grass which is inedible into delicious sustenance in a variety of ways, and the entire ecosystem of life is descibed in this course.

foraging
 - Foraging is an important skill to help when more permanent solutions for things are not yet available. 
first-aid
 - First aid is a vitally important skill when out away from civilization, even if you are in civilization it can be a matter of life and death.
fitness
 - Learning the hidden secrets of minimalistic exercise and understanding of how our physical body works. We go over the ways to properly maintain tendons, joints, ligaments and muscles. As well as how often to eat food.
gardening
 - Gardening is the sustainable way of life. By having a garden you are supporting yourself with food you grow, and also contributing to clean air around your home, and 
measurement-system
 - We teach how to use a relative measurement system, and also the metric system. How to measure everything with a simple string with small pins in it.
math
 - We show how to create a circular slide rule from scratch, as well as how to use it, and furthermore we encourage users how to go through the process of designing math from scratch in a way that fits in with objective mathematic truths especially among the more practical end.
navigation
 - We explain the ins and outs of moon phases, sunlight, and mapping star locations in order to navigate especially useful when out at sea, or traveling at night without a compass.
mining
 - Mining is a suitable replacement for things you normally have to buy at home depot, we'll explain the different types of mining, and how to dig in a quarry with basic tools, as well as what sort of things to be looking for. And how to designate a spot as a suitable mining location.
education
 - We teach the basics of how human beings learn, and how to prevent bias from entering into the picture with public schools and how bias is absolutely ok and in fact a good thing to have in private schools since those parents are paying for the education. But if a parent is not ok with a particular bias they can choose another school.
art
 - We teach that art can teach true principles more effectively holding up a mirror to our souls better than anything else. This is explained well by JBP and also it is why art can be infinitely valueable and has no limit to its monetary value in many instances throughout history. Especially historical art.
Language:
 - We teach the fundamentals of roots prefixes and suffixes and how to use them like a recipe for designing words, but also explain the reason why we have so many words meaning the same things and that kind of break these rules, because for music, art, poems, speeches etc... They change the flow and help improve communication. The main use of roots prefixes and suffixes is for technical studies, because in those cases you are not concerned with flow of speech, and instead you wish to be able to look at a word and understand its meaning without looking it up in a dictionary.
Fullness of Times:
 - We teach about the fullness of times, how God works in His ultimate power to bring heavenly things and ideas and miracles to Earth sometimes. Like the Urim and Thumim and other similar seer stones which would sound absurd to people, except for the fact we have built modern, though not nearly as powerful versions of the Urim and Thumims in our society, and we greatly depend on them.
