My belief is that everything is so perfectly designed in this world for us to make progress, that really the only thing in our way is our own spiritual problems, that we have to work to overcome. And that God created this world with extreme care and precision that we have basically limitless possibilities at our fingertips. We just have to understand how everything was designed, what is the big picture? What was everything designed to do, and how does it all come together for our lives? I recognize a pattern in existence, but I don't yet see the full thing, as I've pursued minimalism and doing more with less, I've come to recognize many patterns that are extremely profound and pragmatic in the vast majority of situations we find ourselves in. I can tell there is a perfect pattern out there somewhere, the closer I get to minimalism and understanding each family of materials I get closer to understanding the universal pattern for this world we inhabit.

My goal with every video is to teach the principle of living 'without'. It is not just about minimalism. It is about how to live without certain things, which is the definition of minimalism true, but the goal is not to live without things, rather it is to know how to live without things, and also for those who are forced to live without things to know how to still live successfully. 

Every video will have basic silent illustrations, then afterwards I'll worry about voiceover or adding subtitles with useful explanations

Video idea Number 1: 
Relative measurement system
 - Take a rope, and show on a white table, exactly how it can be used with nails to measure anything using the imperial system. Explain why it should be preferred over metric system in some situations, and why we should use metric system for everything else. Also explain how people can perform conversion into other measurement systems, (especially metric)
  - Keep the string in a pouch, along with the nails in a separate compartment of the pouch. 

Minimal Exercise equipment system and program [min-exercise]
 - Focus on understanding the most minimal yet effective exercise system based on universal truths about our muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, digestion, arteries, heart, brain and bones. Focus on explaining each of those parts and their roles, and how to effectively exercise them by increasing blood flow and nutrient supply and also accelerate healing or stretch etc...

Minimal diet nutritional system:
 - Focus on minimal supplies providing food and nutrients for our body. For example, your garden provides most of your micronutrients, if you have pigs or cow or chicken combined with food supply grains or home grown grains, they provide your macronutrients of fat, protein and carbs. Your garden can also be used to provide herbs and spices including medicinal ones.

Minimal Garden:
 - Focus on growing the most useful things in the smallest amount of space, and options for people without land (growing pots), and also how to create clay pots, and oyas yourself. Explain the ecosystem of earth and nutrition, the circle of life including animals, plants, insects, fungi, bacteria and humans. Explain that all things in life have their opposite, if something has power for good it also has power for evil. The lesson of this life is to pursue the good and accept the pain of the bad as payment when it happens. Being neutral itself is bad, as you don't progress and natural way of life is for things to decay and die, so we are incentivised always to pursue good life sustaining things. Also explain that growing plants indoors is a way of getting fresh air without needing a ac/fan constantly blowing. Basically you provide the plant carbon dioxide with your breath, the plant provides you oxygen. It's like a indoor air filter. Though there is more to it than this I think, someone should research this more and see if there is any more important details to note about living like this. You can also keep allowing air into your home from outside if you want to be sure. But to raise the oxygen purity in and around your home have lots of plants.

Illustrating observability principles and anomoly detection
 - Focus on explaining all the basic principles of observability and how to implement it in various languages, and also how to create anomoly detection layers. Explain the Redus principle. 

Visur explained
 - Focus on illustrating what Visur would be able to do with edited images. Also explain the underlying idea behind hyperbase, Q, lemon, Visur, Observability bridge, graphQL, MariaDB storage engines etc...

Jerbil, Rebul, and Simpleton
 - Focus on explaining the design principles behind JERBIL, REBUL and Simpleton and why we felt they were necessary and how they work, and their benefits.

Navigation techniques
 - Focus on explaining how navigation works without any tools, just simply looking at the stars, the moon and sun, and also explaining the moon phases for night time travel and other stuff.

Wilderness Experimentation/Tech progression
 - Focus on explaining all the incredible things you can do out in the wilderness by yourself without any tools at all, just starting from scratch. From start to finish (at least as far as I can go with it). Then in this you can describe your failure to understand how patents and copyright help technological innovation in any way at all. And desire to see patents and copyright disappear. Basically this is about tech progression. How people can use deer antlers to create quarries and mine through solid rock, etc... Give credit to many people for this, like HTME, Primitive Technology, Robert Murray Smith, NightHawkInLight, King of Random, that one guy who always talks about science stuff, Cody'sLab, and any others I can remember

Cooking without looking at recipes
 - Show how to cook without looking at recipes except to learn how things interact for things you've never cooked before. Never measure, only go by gut instinct.

Open source ideas:
 - Show people how making my ideas open source is part of my goal to lead by example and hope that more people who previously wanted to keep their ideas to themselves or proprietary would change their minds once I show them all the benefits that open source has. Explain that patents truly don't make much sense, and they hinder technological progress and benefit the rich and powerful and hurt the little guy.

Decentralization:
 - Show people through illustrations how decentralization could fix many of the problems we find with tech, the same way the free market determines what succeeds and fails. Also use this opportunity to teach people about the role of government and what roles it must not play.

Explain the cost and benefit of each one to the environment. Expecially emphasize the cost of wind and solar to the environment that most people don't consider, and that if we got rid of coal and gas, environmentalists would simply find another things to complain about and make the next global level threat. Explain the principle of all extracted energy always equals a loss of order. The question is not how much effect it has, but rather what it is affecting and how long can it last? No matter what we choose to extract energy from it will lead to a lower order earth which means eventually we will all die, but even with the worst energy usage we can think of it would take us many millenia before we would actually cause a serious disaster that threatens the earth. Try not to be too propogandistic though, let people come to their own conclusions, just explain my basic thoughts on it. Explain that energy extraction and usage is where machines really shine, and mechanics are needed. Explain capstans, gears, peg gears, pulleys, block and tackles, exercise machines, windmills, vawts/hawts, steam engine, stirling engine. Also explain natural energy machines like solar oven, grindstone. Also explain batteries, like flywheel, and other amazing mechanisms.

Proffessions 101:
 - Explain how to enter any profession, and also what professions you should strive for. Explain the difference between common and exotic jobs. Explain that some people are extremely well suited for tough or odd jobs, that other people simply cannot do, or are not well suited for and in this way your physical body or mental capabilities make you fit in with society, and you belong. Anybody who has a job belongs in society in my opinion.

Also to be non-confrontational, and 

Psych issues 101:
 - Explain we don't need to take external dmt or drugs to have psychedelic experiences, as they can be experienced by normal life events, dying is one event where dmt is naturally released in our system, but also when we are young we have higher amounts of dmt and I had many dmt trips as a child, nothing quite as extreme as what some people have, but if I really wanted to, I could experience those things naturally without taking any external drug. It just depends on how strong your ability is to manipulate your brain and sub-concious systems. There is plenty of asian literature devoted to this study. Explain also the tips for avoiding dependance where it isn't truly needed.

Addiction recovery 101:
 - Explain how motivation can come in many different forms for us, we shouldn't be ashamed at what motivates us to quit, for example you may wish to be strong enough to avoid something on principle alone, but in reality that is not always powerful enough. Seek for motivation from all avenues if you truly wish to conquer something. Even the promise of money could be a motivation for you. For example a trust could be set up, legally you have to conquer this thing in order to qualify, or something else similar. It is also possible that allowing yourself a lesser version of the addiction is ok as well, just as long as you always avoid the more serious version of it. Then after you have gone one full month without the more serious version you can go to a even lesser version, until you completely erradicate it. Just don't forget to make sure you actually document your progress and write down exactly when and why you fail so you can remember to avoid the same pitfalls the next time you attempt to conquer your addiction.
