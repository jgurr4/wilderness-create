Minimal Exercise system:

This exercise system is based on the ../fitness-guide

Basically we are focusing on different components of our bodies at different days. Below is a example of a weekly routine.

---Weekly routine---
Monday: cardio and joint
Tuesday: tendon and cold (maybe also bone)
Wednesday: tai chi and breath/lung
Thursday: Skill
Friday: muscle and bone

Each workout should take 1 full hour. If you finish the main workout before the hour is up you should always use the remaining time to do tendon/back stretches or tai chi based on what you feel is needed most for your body, pay attention to what you feel in your body, what is in pain or stiff or weak.

see ../fitness-guide for what exercises are good examples for each category of training.

For Thursday skill training, that means do any physical skill you wish to develop, it could be flips, handstanc, high jump, long jump, parkour, gymnastics, sports, kickboxing, archery, horseback riding, cliff diving, facing various fears, etc...

I found some of the best exercises possible for my system. Here are a few of them:

For tight hamstrings:
 - sit on ground and place a weight or immovable object between legs as far forward as you can reach. Reach for it and try to pick it up. Think about letting your stretched hamstrings attempt to be what takes the force.

For tight quads and front knee:
 - Place foot behind body on a loop or ledge that holds the knee in a fully bent position which means the quad should be in a fully stretched position, then try to resist against it using the quad muscle that is fully stretched.

Good tendons exercises:
 - frog hops
